# Text Style Classification between _Dante, Italian and Neapolitan language_: a comparison between CNN, RNNs and Transformer based Classifiers.
A Pytorch implementation of Text Style Classification. 

The goal of this project is to compare different architecture accuracy in predicting 3 italic language styles: _Dante, Italian and Neapolitan_. 

The Classifiers taken in consideration are CNN, RNNs, and Transformer based:
* CNN Classifier: made up of three 2D Convolutional layers with a 3x3 kernel
* RNN Classifier: takes the last hidden state of a RNN and classifies sentences from it
* GRU Classifier: takes the last hidden state of a RNN with GRU cell and classifies sentences from it
* LSTM Classifier: takes the last hidden state of a RNN with LSTM cell and classifies sentences from it
* Transformer Classifier: averages the output of a Transformer Encoder over words in a sentence. It's based of self-attention, as described in . . .
