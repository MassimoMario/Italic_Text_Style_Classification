# Text Style Classification between _Dante, Italian and Neapolitan language_: a comparison between CNN, RNNs and Transformer based Classifiers.
A Pytorch implementation of Text Style Classification. 

The goal of this project is to compare different architecture accuracy in predicting 3 italic language styles: _Dante, Italian and Neapolitan_. 

The Classifiers taken in consideration are based on:
* CNN, Convolutional Neural Network
* RNN, Recursive Neural Network
* GRU, RNN with GRU unit
* LSTM, RNN with LSTM unit
* Transformer, NN based on Attention-mechanism, as described in . . .
