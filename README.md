# Text Style Classification between _Dante, Italian and Neapolitan language_: a comparison between CNN, RNNs and Transformer based Classifiers ðŸ“– ðŸ¤”
A Pytorch implementation of Text Style Classification. 

The goal of this project is to compare different architecture accuracy in predicting 3 italic language styles: _Dante, Italian and Neapolitan_. 

The Classifiers taken in consideration are CNN, RNNs, and Transformer based:
* CNN Classifier: made up of three 2D Convolutional layers with a 3x3 kernel
* RNN Classifier: takes the last hidden state of a RNN and classifies sentences from it
* GRU Classifier: takes the last hidden state of a RNN with GRU cell and classifies sentences from it
* LSTM Classifier: takes the last hidden state of a RNN with LSTM cell and classifies sentences from it
* Transformer Classifier: averages the output of a Transformer Encoder over words in a sentence. It's based of self-attention, as described in . . .

The text corpus taken in consideration for the three language are:
* Dante: _Divina Commedia_
* Italian: _Uno, nessuno e centomila_ by Luigi Pirandello, _I Malavoglia_ by Giovanni Verga
* Neapolitan: _Lo cunto de li cunti_ by Giambattista Basile

# Structure
* [`PRE_TRAINED_TEXT_CLASSIFIER.ipynb`](PRE_TRAINED_TEXT_CLASSIFIER.ipynb) is the main notebook containing pre trained models, classification examples and accuracy computations
* [`TEXT_CLASSIFIER.ipynb`](TEXT_CLASSIFIER.ipynb) is a notebook where all the models are defined and trained, with classification examples and accuracy computations
* [`models.py`](models.py) is the module with model class definitions
* [`data_config.py`](data_config.py) is the module containing the functions for making the dataset in form of torch Dataloaders
* [`training_function.py`](training_function.py) is the module containing the functions for training
* [`accuracy.py`](accuracy.py) is the module containing the function computing model accuracy
* [`text_corpus`](text_corpus) repository contains the three corpus used for training
* [`pretrained`](pretrained) repository contains the .pth files with the parameters from pre-trained models

# Requirements
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pytorch
  
# Usage
First clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MassimoMario/Italic_Text_Style_Classification.git
```

Make sure to have Pytorch installed:
```bash
pip install torch
```

Run cells from [`TEXT_CLASSIFIER.ipynb`](TEXT_CLASSIFIER.ipynb) notebook if you want to train the models yourself, or run [`PRE_TRAINED_TEXT_CLASSIFIER.ipynb`](PRE_TRAINED_TEXT_CLASSIFIER.ipynb) for using pre-trained models. Both notebooks have classification examples  and accuracy computation after every model section.
# Results

# Bonus
Since when we italians are young, we learn in school that _Inferno, Purgatorio_ and _Paradiso_, the three main parts of _Divina Commedia_, have been written in 3 different styles.

Can these models capture these stylistic differences? 


It seems they can't  ðŸ˜ž
